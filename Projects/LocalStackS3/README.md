![Example Steps](./Static/example.png)

1. Run localstack: `docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 -p 4571:4571 localstack/localstack`
(-it will show the shell running so you can see all the requests being logged!)
2. Run `aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 ls` to check you can hit S3
3. If you want to config sys vars, do so using `aws config`
4. Create the bucket `aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 mb s3://localstack-bucket`
5. Now you are good to go!

## üèéÔ∏è How to run 
1. dotnet build
2. dotnet run
3. visit: http://localhost:5000/swagger

## ‚öñÔ∏è Final Remarks
This is GREAT if you want to test AWS development without all the headache of setting up a dev environment. In practice, you can run local stack as your dev environment, speeding up the process of getting things on the cloud/generatig POCs.
To see all services supported by LocalStack, visit: https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/services/ it is quite extensive.
