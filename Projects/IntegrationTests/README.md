## 🤷‍♂️ What does it do?
This project is a fantastic example of having an API project and and integration tests classlib testing those APIs.

This is a game changer on the quality assurace front as this allows you to test your APIs E2E in the "Development" environment.

## 🛠️ Project setup
No additional setup required.

## 🏎️ How to run 
dotnet test

## ⚖️ Final Remarks
Fairly simple but potent example of working API integration tests. The key for this to work is the `public partial class Program { }` inserted into the Program.cs
