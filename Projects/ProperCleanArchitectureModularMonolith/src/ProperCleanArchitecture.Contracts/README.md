# 📝 Contracts
Contains shared contracts (DTOs/Exceptions e.t.c) that are used between modules.

ALL modules use these contracts, they perfectly represent the information that is passed from one sub system to another.

It is critical that like the other libraries in this app, we slice the folders like feature level modules to maintain consistency.
