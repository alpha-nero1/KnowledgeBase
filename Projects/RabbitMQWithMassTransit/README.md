## üõ†Ô∏è Project creation
sln: `dotnet new sln -n ActiveMQ`

## ‚úÖ Spin up RabbitMQ locally
Broker listens on amqp://localhost:5672, Management UI at http://localhost:15672 (guest / guest)
`docker run -d --name rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 masstransit/rabbitmq`

## ‚öñÔ∏è Final Notes
This project was extremely easy to set up, MassTransit really does take care of alot of the heavy lifting for you with queues. I think about it like the Mediator of working with queues.

It was just so straight forward.
