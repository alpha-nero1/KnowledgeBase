# AI Software Development Team

This is a capstone project of the "TheCompleteAgenticAIEngineeringCourse" and demonstrates a heirarchical agentic workflow using the agents SDK.

In this project we set up a development team with a:
1. Team leader
2. Front end dev
3. Back end dev
4. Tester

The software development team takes a prompt and works out the solution, executing code and debugging untill workable software is produced. This essentially simulates copilot.
