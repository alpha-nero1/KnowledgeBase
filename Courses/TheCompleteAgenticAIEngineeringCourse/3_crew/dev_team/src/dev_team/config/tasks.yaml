design_task:
  description: >
    Take the high level requirements described here and prepare a detailed design for the engineer;
    everything should be in 1 python module, but outline the classes and methods in the module.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
    IMPORTANT: Only output the design in markdown format, laying out in detail the classes and functions in the module, describing the functionality.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed design for the engineer, identifying the classes and functions in the module.

clarification_request_task:
  description: >
    Review the design provided by the engineering lead and identify any ambiguities, unclear requirements, or implementation concerns.
    Ask specific clarifying questions about the design to ensure you understand all the details before implementation.
    List each question clearly.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed list of clarifying questions about the design.

clarification_response_task:
  description: >
    Review the clarifying questions asked by the backend engineer about your design.
    Provide clear, detailed answers to each question to help them understand the requirements and design decisions.
  expected_output: >
    Clear and detailed responses to all the backend engineer's clarifying questions.

backend_task:
  description: >
    Write a python module that implements the design described by the engineering lead, in order to achieve the requirements.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
    Use the clarifications and answers provided to guide your implementation.
  expected_output: >
    A python module that implements the design and achieves the requirements.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.

frontend_task:
  description: >
    Write a gradio UI in a module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class in {module_name}.
    Assume there is only 1 user, and keep the UI very simple indeed - just a prototype or demo.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
  expected_output: >
    A gradio UI in module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class.
    The file should be ready so that it can be run as-is, in the same directory as the backend module, and it should import the backend class from {module_name}.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.

    Write unit tests for the given backend module {module_name} and create a test_{module_name} in the same directory as the backend module.

    A test_{module_name} module that tests the given backend module.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
