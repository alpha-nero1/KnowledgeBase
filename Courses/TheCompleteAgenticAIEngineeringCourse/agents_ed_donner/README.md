## Master AI Agentic Engineering -  build autonomous AI Agents

### Lesson Summaries
1.4 - Building chat bot that responds to CV questions.
1.5 - Building the AI reasoning loop.
2.2 - simple function tools (just use decorator), Calling agents as tools (.as_tool func), using Handoffs
2.3 - Models other than openai, structured outputs & guardrails.
2.4 - Deep research model for models that search the internet using openai hosted tools like `WebSearchTool`

### Notes
2026-01-22
Handoffs differ from tools in that they hand off the entire job to another AI if it realises another AI is better equipped for the job.
Do we have access to view traces if we are just using th chat gpt agent but interacting with our own MCP server?

Bit confusing the difference between 2.2 & 2.3 was not super clear.
Once the lesson is done, rename it with a more descriptive name.
