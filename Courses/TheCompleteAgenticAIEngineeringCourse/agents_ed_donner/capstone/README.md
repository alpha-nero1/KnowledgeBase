# Capstone Project

In this capstone project the goal is to do the following from scratch:

Market Research Team
You have an idea but need to validate it via market research, you want a team of agents behind this in order to validate or invalidate ideas.
The market research team needs several agents:
- Manager agent (defines requirements)
- Researcher agent (searches the web)
- Analysis agent (analyses the searches)
- Synthesiser agent (summarises the analysis)

The research team must have access to an MCP server to allow it to send_emails, search the web e.t.c.

The market research team must be able to search, analyse, synthesise and notify the user about the completed research.

Bonus points for having the email attach a readible PDF containing the outcome, also not all agents should have access to all tools, figure out a way to segment the mcp server.

The agents must all make use of an MCP server instead of direct tool use to demonmstrate MCP server utility.
