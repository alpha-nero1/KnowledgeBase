# Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass
A project following along with the "Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass" class by Jose Portilla on Udemy.

Note that the folder 'project' contains an actual flask server implementation that loads a
random forest regressor model and does predictions over an API.

## ML Pathway Overview
- Supervised learning = trying to predict an outcome
- Unsupervised learning = dicover patterns in data

## NumPy
Many many Data Science libraries are built powered by NumPy.
It is a library for creating N-dimensional arrays.
- NumPy structures look similar to python lists but they are much more efficient.

## Pandas
Is a library for data analysis, uses a dataframe system built off NumPy.
- Has fantastic docs: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

## What can we do with it?
Comes built in with tools for reading and writing data (or files)
- Can read/write directly to external data sources (databases + html tables)
- Can intelligently retreive data (to handle missing data and adjustment)
- the "Excel for python" but so much more than that.
- Only limited by how much RAM you have, no limit to size of opening files.

Series = one-dimensional ndarray with axis labels

- Allows arrays to have row labels.
